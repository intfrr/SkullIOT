The important code here is skullserver.py

To run it

pip install -r requirements.txt

python skullserver.py


Note
This code was written on Linux Mint, I will be using it on windows pretty soon. But there is no intelligence in checking out the Serial Port.
However the Arduino code responds to an instruction to achive that eventually.
